# STS
Save Their Souls is a raspberryPi based project designed to teach students computing topics

## Computing topics covered
1. Computer Engineering
2. Computer Science
3. Human Centered computing
4. Data Science 
5. Graphics/Design

## Project
This repository contains code and lessons plans for a game and joystick drivers. 
The goal of this project is to teach fundamental programming concepts to a beginner audience using specific functionalities as examples and mini projects for the students.

### Project Infrastructure

#### Learning portion
This project is divided into two pieces: the first is the learning element and the second is the game element. All of the learning elements are in the Class_Plans folder. The learning tool takes up the rest of the files. 

#### Example portion

pong.py is the main program of the learning tool. 
pong.py gets output wrapper classes from Drivers/, specifically GetInput.py which contains all of the output wrapper classes. 

## Overview of Computing topics

### Computer Engineering

Computer engineering is the discipline of hardware to software connections.
In this project, the hardware to software connection is between the custom controller and the game.

Hardware information can be passed to software processes in a few standardized ways. 
This project will go over two of these ways: spi and i2c without going into too many specifics.
Students will learn how to get information from sensors with basic bread boarding and simple python scripts. 

### Computer Science

Computer science is a very broad discipline describing the way in which we communicate with and use computers.
In this project, everything from the data collection, data processing, to game design all fall under the scope of computer science.
For the sake of clarity however, we will be focusing on how computers communicate amongst each other as our main focus when discussing computer science.

Network communication is a very broad and complicated subject so we will be focusing on the basics. 
`Finish describing basic computer communication topics`

The game which is included in this project will contain multiplayer capabilites. We will use the multiple different methods of communication to demonstrate how computers initiate communication, where and how computers send information, and how we process that information in a way that's useful to us. 

### Data Science

Data science is the process of collecting and processing large amounts of data to produce a useful or desireable function.
In this project, data science will be applied by creating different levels of AI for the opponent in single player mode.

Machine learning `Give definition and use cases`

### Human Centered Computing

Human Centered Computing deals with the development and deployment of mixed systems focused on human computer interactions. 
`Describe how it is relevent to the project`

### Graphical and User interface design 

Graphics and User Interface(UI) design is the processes of creating visuals for different aspects of a program which you and I will interact with.
